# logistics-shipment-sql-analysis
SQL analysis on logistics shipment data to explore delivery delays, carrier efficiency, and cost optimization.

The goal was to identify what factors influence delivery delays and how to optimize carrier selection based on cost and transit time.

Using SQL, I performed data cleaning, descriptive analytics, and performance analysis, examining metrics such as delivery times, cost per distance, carrier reliability, and delay rates by region.
